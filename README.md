 Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English

## Abstract
In recent years, written language, particularly in science and
education, has undergone remarkable shifts in word usage.
These changes are widely attributed to the growing influence
of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely
on a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output
and target audience norms can be viewed as a form of mis-
alignment. While these shifts are often linked to using Arti-
ficial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to generate text, it
remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes
in the human language system itself. To explore this ques-
tion, we constructed a dataset of 22.5 million words from un-
scripted spoken language drawn from conversational science
and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends before
and after ChatGPT’s release in 2022, focusing on commonly
LLM-associated words. Our results show a moderate increase
in the usage of these words post-2022, suggesting a mild con-
vergence between human word choices and LLM-associated
patterns. In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no con-
sistent directional shift. While we are the first to demonstrate
such trends in unscripted spoken language, whether this rep-
resents natural language change or a novel shift driven by AI
exposure remains an open question. Similarly, although the
shifts may stem from broader adoption patterns, it may also
be that upstream training misalignments ultimately contribute
to changes in human language use. These findings parallel
ethical concerns that misaligned models may shape social and
moral beliefs.

## Requirements and Running the Code

### Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenAI Whisper Base Model** (for audio transcription)
- **spaCy** (for POS tagging and lemmatization)
- **Python libraries**: spaCy, scipy 

Install dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install openai-whisper spacy pandas numpy scipy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Running the Analysis

1. **Transcribe podcast audio** (if transcripts are not provided):
```bash
whisper podcast_audio.mp3 --model base --language en
```

2. **Lemmatize and POS-tag transcriptions**:
```bash
python ""
```

3. **Conduct lexical trend analysis**:
```bash
python ""
```

## Notes on Code
- Transcripts not provided by podcasts were generated using **OpenAI Whisper (base model)**.
- Lemmatization and POS-tagging were done using spaCy's **`en_core_web_sm` model**.
- Lexical frequency analysis was conducted using occurrences per million (**OPM**).
- Statistical significance was assessed using the **chi-square contingency table test**.
